## MySQL Fundamentals: Analyzing Sales Data

### Project Description
This project involves analyzing sales data using SQL. The goal is to perform various queries to gain insights into the sales performance of a company. The analysis includes retrieving data, calculating totals and averages, identifying top-performing regions and products, and more.
### Dataset
[Sales dataset](https://witscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/2168978_students_wits_ac_za/EUdSzYo6vnVKjp7EA9TMQY0BNWGA4tWtOor8H1VDsvpxKg?e=MrBH2M)
### Requirements
- Dataset: The provided sample dataset contains sales data with the following columns:
  1. Date: Date of the sale
  2. Product: Name of the product sold
  3. Sales: Total sales revenue generated
  4. Profit: Profit earned from the sale
  5. Region: Region where the sale occurred
- Provide explanations and interpretations of the results obtained from each query.
- Organize the analysis in a clear and structured manner.
- Use SQL functions and clauses to enhance the analysis.
- Take a screenshot of the code and the results in the solution document.

### Technologies Used
- MySQL

### Methods
