### Step-by-Step Guide to Run the MySQL Code

#### 1. Install MySQL Workbench
- Here is a youtube tutorial on how to install [MySQL workbench](https://youtu.be/BxdSUGBs0gM?si=VMxhT4WOfB7cYTTT)
- Download and install MySQL Workbench from the official MySQL website: [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)

#### 2. Create a Schema
- Open MySQL Workbench.
- In the Navigator pane on the left side, locate and expand the "SCHEMAS" section.
- Right-click on the empty space within the "SCHEMAS" section and select "Create Schema...".
- Enter "company_sales" as the name for the schema and click "Apply".

#### 3. Import the Table
- Download the provided dataset or use the table named "sales".
- In MySQL Workbench, right-click on the "company_sales" schema that you just created.
- Select "Table Data Import Wizard".
- Follow the wizard to import the table named "sales" into the "company_sales" schema.
- Make sure to specify the correct file or database connection for importing the table.

#### 4. Run the MySQL Code
- Open the MySQL script file containing the code you want to run.
- Make sure the schema is set to "company_sales" at the top of the script, or specify it explicitly in the queries.
- Highlight the queries you want to execute.
- Click the lightning bolt icon or use the shortcut (Ctrl+Enter) to run the selected queries.
- Review the results in the output panel to verify the execution of the queries.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that MySQL Workbench is properly configured and connected to your MySQL server instance.
- Double-check the schema name and table name to ensure they match the names used in the MySQL code.
- Modify the queries as needed to suit your specific analysis
